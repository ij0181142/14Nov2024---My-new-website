        <h1>India's most successful star gave 400 hits, 50 blockbusters; way more than Amitabh, Rajinikanth, Shah Rukh Khan combined</h1>
        <img src="./img5/5.avif">
        <p>720 films as hero, 400 hits, 50 blockbusters, and 30 films in a single year - the staggering achievements of India's most successful star are beyond belief.
            The term India's most successful actor usually evokes thoughts of the usual suspects - Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Dilip Kumar, or even Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan. These have been some of the biggest superstars in Indian cinema, all of whom have starred in some of the biggest films of all time and given more hits than most actors can dream of. Yet, the crown does not belong to any of them, for there is one man who gave more hits as a leading man than all of them put together.

        <p>Malayalam screen idol Prem Nazir holds multiple world records courtesy of his prolific career. A cultural icon in Kerala, Prem Nazir ruled Malayalam cinema for three decades. In a career that spanned from 1951-89, Nazir worked as the lead in a staggering 720 films, a world record for a while. He did this by working double or even triple shifts throughout his peak, appearing in as many as 30 films in a year twice (another world record). This prolific nature was combined with an exemplary strike rate of hits, as most of his films were successful. Industry insiders and trade analysts estimate that more than half of Nazir's films as hero were box office successes, with estimates ranging from 350-500. But most film historians agree that Nazir starred in at least 400 hit films as a hero, of which 50 attained blockbuster status at the box office.</p>
        <p>To understand how monumental Prem Nazir's record is, one just needs to compare it to some of the other big stars. Amitabh Bachchan, arguably Indian cinema's biggest name, has fewer than 60 hits as a leading man, 10 of which are blockbusters. South superstar Rajinikanth, who has been more prolific than his Bollywood contemporary, is a little ahead with over 80 hits and over a dozen blockbusters.</p>
